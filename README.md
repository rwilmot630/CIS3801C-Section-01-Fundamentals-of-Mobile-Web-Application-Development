## CIS3801C-Section-01-Fundamentals-of-Mobile-Web-Application-Development Final Project

This is the github repository for my mobile web project.

### Installation

This site is html and php, therefore you can simply download it and host it anywhere. However, it does rely on a local database to serve the menu items. Once you have a database, you can simply edit the connection information located in config.php to allow this site to connect properly.

### Usage

There are three potential use cases for this site. 

  1. You want to know more about the restaraunt this site is based on. In this case, feel free to explore the site and learn more.
  
  2. You want to host it somewhere so that other people can explore it. This would require the permission of the people who own the resteraunt and the images thereof. In the meantime, if you wish to share about the resteraunt, your best bet would be to use their facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/TheMinneSodaFountain/.
  
 3. You are student trying to learn something. There are probably better examples of web development out there, but if you can glean something from my humble project then please do. We are in this learning process together.
